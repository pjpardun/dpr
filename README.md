## About
A desktop application to generate data points from a raw data file and perform piecewise/segmented linear regression with a GUI that supports multiple options for both data point optimatization and time series recode treatment for regression, as well as visualization of datapoints and regression tables, plots, and statistics.

This project was built to fill a software gap at my place of employment.
